Shipper and shipping method
---------------------------

Indicates the shipper and shipping method the supplier should use to
ship the items back to us. This does not currently (as of 2013-03-05)
create any shipments with the shipper -- instead, our account info
(such as our UPS account number) appears on the PO so the supplier can ship
on our account.
