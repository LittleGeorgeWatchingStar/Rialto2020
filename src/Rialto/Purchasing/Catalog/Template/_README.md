# Purchasing data templates

We can't manually create purchasing data records for each Geppetto board
and PCB because soon our delighted customers will be designing and ordering
hundreds of new boards each week! Nor can we find them in a supplier's online 
catalog because each one is a completely novel design!

So we define purchasing data "templates" that describe how to automatically
create purchasing data records for each new Geppetto design based on pricing
agreements that we have with our CMs.
