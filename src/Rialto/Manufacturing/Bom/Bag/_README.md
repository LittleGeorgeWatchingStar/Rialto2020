# Bag automation

Geppetto automatically creates boards in Rialto and populates the BOM
(Bill of Materials) for those boards.

Now, boards need to ship inside of a bag, preferably an ESD bag. But
it's not Geppetto's job to know or care about that stuff -- that's Rialto's
job.

This directory contains the automation for finding a suitable bag
for a new board and adding the bag to the board's BOM.
